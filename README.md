This repository contains a collection of basic Python programs and exercises that Iâ€™ve created as part of my ongoing learning journey.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals
- Practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Build a habit of writing clean, well-structured code
- Track my progress as I advance in my programming skills

## Contents

- Control structures and loops
- Functions and recursion
- File handling
- Basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.)
- Practice problems and mini-projects

## Tools

- Python 3
- Standard libraries only (unless otherwise noted)

## Notes

This repository is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.  
While the projects are simple, they reflect consistent practice and a focus on writing readable, maintainable code.
